#+title: Personal website.

This repo contains the source files for my static website. It uses
GitHub actions to automatically build and deploy it to [[https://domse007.github.io/website/][GitHub Pages]].

The source files consist of org documents (located in =source/=), which
are transpiled into html documents using the =org-export= backend.

* Building
The only requirement for building is emacs and an internet connection.
The script will install all dependencies and generate the =public/=
directory with all content.

You can use the Makefile

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

or invoke emacs with the following command:

#+begin_src sh
emacs -q --script publish.el
#+end_src

* Serving
=M-x httpd-serve-directory RET public RET=
