This site contains thoughts and notes mostly about Emacs, Rust and GNU/Linux.

* Emacs
There is the joke that linux users spend too much time working on
their dotfiles. This applies to me as well. I spend hundreds of hours
into my emacs [[https://www.github.com/domse007/.emacs.d][config]]. The result is a pretty fast, host and platform
independant config.

While tinkering with the config or writing small packages, I find a
lot of amusing things:
- [[file:elisp-classes.org][Emacs lisp is OOP]]
- [[file:lspce.org][A guide to install lspce]]
- [[file:elisp.org][My grieveances with elisp]]

* Scripting
- [[file:fzf.org][Optimizing interactive fzf usage]]

* Website
The build script is also just another article that is tangled into
the script:
- [[file:publish.org][The build script]]

In the future, the =JS= and =CSS= files will also be converted into
articles, that will be compiled into the =html= and the effective "code"
files.
